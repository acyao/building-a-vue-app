The Vue-CLI project includes all the configuration necessary to run, test and build the Vue.js project. It follows conventions that are recommended by the Vue.js community.

The `build` directory contains the webpack configuration files, including environment-specific config for dev, prod, and test environments.

The `config` directory contains non-build related configuration, including environment-specific config as described above. One config property of interest is `SERVER_URL`, which points to the URL of the Grails `server` application, and is set by default to `http://localhost:8080`. You can edit this to point to another server if needed.

TIP: While they serve a similar function, please remember that the Vue/webpack environment settings aren't related directly to Grails environments - e.g., if you run/build your Grails project with a specific environment, it won't automatically affect the environment in the `client` project.

The `static` directory contains static assets that should not be processed by webpack - you won't be using it in this guide.

The `test`  directory contains unit and integration (end-to-end) tests for the Vue.js app.

The `src` directory contains the actual source code for our Vue.js project. It includes subdirectories for components, assets (e.g., CSS files), and the default Vue-Router configuration. This is a typical project structure for a Vue.js app, however you can apply whatever directory structure suits your needs within the `src` directory. This is where we will be spending most of our time in the remainder of this guide.
