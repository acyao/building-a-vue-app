The Vue profile generates a multi-project build, with `server` and `client` subprojects. The `server` project is a Grails application using the `rest-api` profile, while `client` is a Vue application generated with Vue-CLI's http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/[webpack template]. In order to run the entire project, you will need to start the `server` and `client` applications separately.

Change into the `initial` directory:
[source,bash]
----
$ cd initial/
----

To launch the Grails application, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew server:bootRun
----

The Grails application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

To start the Vue.js app, open a second terminal session in the same directory, and run the following command:


[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew client:start
----

The Vue.js app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. Browse to that URL and you should see the default "Welcome" page.
