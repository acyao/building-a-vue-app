There's plenty of opportunities to expand the scope of this application. Here are a few ideas for improvements you can make on your own:

 - Improve the form (or create new form components) for adding Makes, Models, and Drivers.
 - Add support for editing existing Vehicles, perhaps using a modal dialog for an edit form.
 - Currently the Makes & Model domain classes are independent. Add an appropriate GORM association between Make & Model, and change the select lists to only display Models for the currently select Make. You will want to make use of the JavaScript https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter[`Array.filter`] method.
